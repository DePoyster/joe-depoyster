## Project Quirks/ Things that don't work
* Sadly, there are a lot of features I didn't get around to building.
 Namly, I bailed on actually using my database: ran out of time.
 Adding the connecting function from mongo.js to the server code, I was able to see that I had accessed my database, and I got everything set up on Azure.
 But I have little to show for database points.
* My vision for this project was a lot more "unique from or dedicated expansion on class examples"
I know the project doesn't render 'high effort' appearing results, but I really did try to create a good foundation that I can use in the future to make something cool!
Learning react routing, databases, perfecting server side rendering and having it all neat and comprehensable to me took more time than expected.
If I had more time, I could really start going at it and add all of the gimmicky features I had in my plan; I'm definitely going to keep working from this project in the future.
